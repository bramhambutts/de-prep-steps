We need more than one table! Please create a table called 'baked_goods'.

'baked_goods' should contain the following columns:
- baked_good_id : integer (primary key)
- baked_good_name: text (not null)
- bakery: text
- stock: integer

Then, insert the data (found in data/baked_goods.txt) and make sure that all the data has been inserted properly with a SELECT command.
